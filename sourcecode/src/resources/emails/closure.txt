Dear Ms. Davis,



I hope this letter finds you well. I am writing to request the closure of my loan account with Citadel Financial Bank. I have been a satisfied customer of your esteemed institution for the past five years, and I am extremely grateful for the financial assistance provided to me throughout the loan tenure.



I am pleased to inform you that due to my meticulous financial planning and disciplined savings habits, I have managed to accumulate the necessary funds to pay off my loan in full. Therefore, I kindly request your assistance in closing my account and providing me with the necessary documentation confirming the closure.



As a responsible borrower, it has always been my top priority to ensure timely repayments. I have diligently made all the required monthly installments without any delays or defaults. Enclosed with this letter, you will find a detailed statement of my account, which clearly shows that no outstanding amount is due.



I understand that loan closures may involve certain administrative procedures. Therefore, I would greatly appreciate it if you could guide me through the necessary steps and inform me of any paperwork or formalities that need to be completed for the closure process. I am more than willing to provide any additional documents or information that may be required.


It has been a pleasure being associated with Citadel Financial Bank, and I would like to express my sincere gratitude for the exceptional level of service I have received from your staff members. Your bank's commitment to customer satisfaction is truly commendable. If there are any further discussions or clarifications required regarding the loan closure, please do not hesitate to contact me through email at sarah@email.com or via phone at 222 555 7777.



Once again, I extend my deepest appreciation for the assistance provided by ABC Bank, and I sincerely hope for a smooth and hassle-free closure process. Please find attached the necessary documents for your reference and verification.
